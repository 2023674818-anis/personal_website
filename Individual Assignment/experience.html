	    	<h2>Industrial Training</h2>
	        <p>I have undergone industrial training for Subject IMD310 this semester for 2 months. I underwent the training in the IT department in the hospital. I started the training alone and ended up with a friend. Although it was temporary, I appreciate all the experiences there. I also got friendly workers to guide me throughout the training.</p>

	    	<h2>Go Green Go Clean Explorance</h2>
	        <p>In 2023, when I was in my first semester, there was a program that caught my attention to participate called Explorance organized by the college. At that time, I was interested because every program in the college would provide a coupon which played a role in maintaining residence in the college dormitory. I attended this program with 2 other friends. This program was played in groups and there were various types of games at each checkpoint. I think through this program I was able to get to know more people in this university. This is also one of the experiences that I will never forget.</p>

	    	<h2>The Trip to the Kidzania</h2>
	        <p>In 2018, I had the opportunity to visit Kidzania in Kuala Lumpur to explore a career that I was interested in. At that time, I was accompanied by my best friend to go together. We tried various jobs and played games there. This was also one of the best experiences I have had. Among the jobs I did there was being a doctor taking care of newborns and another was being a researcher where there were many folders I had to explore.</p>

	        <p>In 2022, I was given the opportunity by the counseling teacher to attend the SPM Question Answering Camp as one of the PERHATI members at De Rhu Beach Resort, Sungai Karang. PERHATI is a Permata Hati Orphanage Program which only involves Form 5 students. The camp was held for 3 days and 2 nights. There were various kiosks offering interesting study places, one of which was <abbr title="Kolej Poly-Tech MARA">KPTM</abbr>.</p>

	    	<h2>Babysitting</h2>
	        <p>My mother has been working as a nanny at home since 2012 when I was 7 years old. At that time, I played a lot with the children she looked after. Now, I help her a lot in terms of feeding and bathing the children. From the beginning until now, the total number of children my mother has looked after is 15. Most of them are children that my mother took from teachers' children and the age limit that my mother can afford is from 3 months old until they enter school or the parents don't want to send them anymore. Through this experience, I learned a lot about children's body language or how to communicate with them.</p>
