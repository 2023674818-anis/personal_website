	<h2>Falling for Life in Yellow</h2>
	<p style="background-color: lightyellow;"><img src="animation/yellow.gif">Of the many colors that exist, the one that catches my eye the most is yellow. I like it because it's bright and shiny. I also learned about the symbolism of the color yellow. It is said that <q>yellow represents joy, optimism, and intellectual energy. It symbolizes the warmth of friendship, the excitement of new ideas, and the confidence that comes from mental clarity.</q> Indirectly, it makes me love things like sunsets and sunflowers. This color can give me the peace and new energy that I need when I am under stress. In addition, this color can be combined with any color and it becomes beautiful and stylish. For example, yellow and purple.</p>
