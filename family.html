	<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">I have 4 members in my family including me. I have a father, a mother and an older brother. I am obviously the youngest member in this family. <br>~Let me introduce them to you.~</p>

	      	<div class="title">
	          <h2>Ahmad Husain</h2>
	          <p>My one & only Dad</p>
	        </div>
	        <p>He is protective and cheerful. He is also a firm person. I see him as an inspiration in my life because he always accepted his weaknesses as a strength to rise up. His love cannot be seen but can be felt. Honestly, I was more comfortable expressing myself to my father than to my mother.</p>

	          <h2>Siti Mariam Abd Rahim</h2>
	          <p>My Beloved Mom</p>
	        </div>
	        <p>In contrast to her husband, she may seem fierce but only those who know her know how soft-hearted she is. She is the one who cares about what all her children like and tries her best to fulfill them. Even though I only mention the wish for a moment or just as a joke, but not for her.</p>

	          <h2>Abdul Muiz Qidam Ahmad</h2>
	          <p>My Respected Brother</p>
	        </div>
	        <p>He spends a lot of time alone but he likes to share what he's going through all the time. We don't spend much time together but I still feel his concern and I'm comfortable with that. I hope this side of him doesn't change because it's one of the things that still ties this family together.</p>
